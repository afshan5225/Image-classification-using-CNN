# CNN Image Classification: Cats vs Dogs

## Problem Statement

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using a labeled dataset of images.

## Methodology

1. Load and preprocess images from the dataset.
2. Label images as either 'cat' or 'dog' based on filenames.
3. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
4. Use image augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, flip, etc.) to enhance model training.
5. Design and train a CNN model with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout for regularization.
6. Evaluate the model on validation data and save the trained model for future use.
